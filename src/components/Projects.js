                Welcome to the Start of a Beautiful New Relationship.  Born and raised in New York City.
                The diverse multi-ethnic culture of NY has always influenced me from a child.
                Therefore, my approach to my work before web development has always been to find the
                voice of a client so that it would be heard.  My projects are a representation of my ability to
                not stick to a particular design or style.
